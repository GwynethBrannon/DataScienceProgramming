# Session 5 :: Operating with Multiple Tables
This session covers methods of combining multiple data frames.

**Why are databases so complex?**

Consistency when updating: no duplicate places for information https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization
Performance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema


**How to Join**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)
Two tables can be joined at a time. 'Join' is a binary operator. (Commutations and associations may produce different results, though.)
Tables must have key values that can be matched. Usually one table has a primary key and the other table has a foreign key.
