## NumPy, Matplotlib
- Date: 2016-09-15
- In class: Lecture, Hands-on, Quiz 2
- Due before class: HW 2 -- PandasExercise

### Description
We ill explore some of the NumPy functionality as it relates to Pandas DataFrames and introduce Matplotlib to create visual representations.

We're going to work on the notebook `APD-Crime-Data_orig.ipynb`. Please, rename to `APD-Crime-Data.ipynb`
before you start working on it.

### Homework HW3
1. Use the given data to tell three(3) insights into crime in Atlanta. For each: pose the question, create a plot to show the results, and briefly explain the insight.
2. Pick one of the Part 1 crime types (...not arson, or rape) and develop a predictive model based on seasonality (by month) and annual trends.
